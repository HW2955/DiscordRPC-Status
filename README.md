# DiscordRPC-Status
Long forgotten thing i've made, in contrast to the skidds, this one can refresh the large image
## Installing
For this to work you will need to install these node modules:
- discord `not discord.js (these are two different things!)`
- discord-rpc
After that you'll have lots of useless modules that came bundled with these^
So, ones that are crutial for this to work are:
- discord
- discord-rpc
- node-fetch
- ws
You can delete the remaining ones.
